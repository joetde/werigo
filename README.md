# Werigo

Small application to accumulate the locations and paths you went.

Features:
- The more you pass on a given location, the hotter the color will be. Let __12 hours__ for the app to consider you passed on the same location, otherwise the location is just ignored.
- Will start to consider points for a minimum accuracy of __30 meters__, if your GPS go a bit crazy, the location won't be recorded. 

Limitations:
- Uses Google Maps free API which is limited to 1000 accesses per day.
- All the data is stored locally, you won't be able to recover your data if you flash your phone or erase the data associated with the app.

Disclaimer:
This application is part of time limited project. Feel free to submit your patches in case for problems/suggestions, I'll be happy to merge and publish a new version.
